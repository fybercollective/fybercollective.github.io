Cotton fabric, cotton batting, invisible thread. Sewn on a domestic sewing machine.

Stable Diffusion was used to generate a quilt design. Fabrics were sourced and used to match the design, and sewn together on a domestic machine. This first shot is a finished quilt, based on a pattern generated by a stable diffusion build. Below (left) is the generated image.
